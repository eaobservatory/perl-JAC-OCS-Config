JAC::OCS::Config
=================

Perl modules for parsing and creating JCMT OCS Configuration XML files.
Currently suitable for ACSIS. In the future also suitable for SCUBA-2.

Since this can be used for parsing/creating XML configuration files
that are used by the PTCS at both JCMT and UKIRT, a JAC:: class prefix
is used. See http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACdocs/JCMT/OCS/ICD/006/
